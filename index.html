    <p class="bio">I am an American most recently living in Seattle where I worked in State and      Local  Government as well as the NonProfit world.
    While I lived in Seattle I took full advantage of all the outdoor activites availale in the surrounding area and spent most of my off work time outdoors.
    Just over a year ago I got married and moved to Palermo Sicily where I now live and am starting training for a new career. </p>
